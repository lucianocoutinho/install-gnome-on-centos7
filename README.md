## Install graphical environment (minimal Gnome) on CentOS 7 minimal ##

The purpose of this script is to install a minimal GNOME environment in a CentOS 7
installed with the minimal iso.

I do this thing so many times that I decided to put it in a script so this can be
useful for other. I hope :-)

This was tested only in virtual machines. Any contribution is always welcome.
